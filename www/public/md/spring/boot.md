# Spring Boot
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot

## Goals
* 매우 빠른 스프링 개발
* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
